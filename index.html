<p>A croissant is a buttery flaky viennoiserie bread roll named for its well known crescent shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a sheet. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. Croissants have long been a staple of French bakeries and p√¢tisseries. The croissant is one of the most well-known item of French food in much of the world and remains popular in a continental breakfast.</p>
